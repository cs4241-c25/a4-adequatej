Project Summary: 
Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3.

A dynamic web application that allows users to manage and rate anime entries. The application uses CSS Flexbox for layout positioning, particularly in the form groups and main container structure. The system calculates a popularity score based on the rating and number of episodes, providing users with a derived metric for each anime entry.

I re-implemented Assignment A3 using React components, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, and NextJS with NextAuth for authentication.
